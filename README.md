## Overview
sdfsdfdsf

From 2019 - 2022 over 108K orders were placed, generating $28.1M in sales. Across these 4 years, sales and order count are up 28%. Not to be overlooked is DotDash's meteoric sales boom in 2020 (163%). A signficant portion of this rise can be attributed to the paradigm shift in customer behavior, to order online, observed during the start of the pandemic. However beginning in 2022, the trend in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has taken a sharp dive. Hence, the battle lies in finding ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021, which should outline our path to longer-term growth.




**What were the overall trends?**

- **Yearly summary:** From 2019 to 2022, average number of sales per year was 27K, with average yearly sale revenue of $7M and average order value of $254. 2021 saw the highest number of sales (36K), but 2020 had on average the most expensive sales (AOV of $300).
- **Growth rates:** 2020 had by far the highest growth rate, with more than double the number of sales and the total sales revenue than 2019. On average, 2020 sales were also 31% more expensive than 2019 sales. While 2021 exhibited positive growth in the number of sales, total sales revenue went down, as people purchased items that were an average of 15% less expensive than in 2021.

**Should we keep using the loyalty program?**

- **Findings:** During 2019 and 2020, loyalty program customers made fewer purchases than non-loyalty program customers, and their purchases were less expensive than non-loyalty customers. However, in more recent years (2021-2022), loyalty customers not only made more purchases than non-loyalty customers, but also purchased about $30 more on average in 2022.
- **Recommendation:** Considering the fact that in recent years, loyalty customers are not only making more purchases but also more expensive purchases than non-loyalty customers, we would recommend continuing with the loyalty program.
