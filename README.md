### Sales Insights

#### Findings:

<img width="320" alt="Sales by Year" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/496a7b04-cfc9-41e6-b981-1a9e566d56ac">
<br><br>

- **Revenue and Order Trends:** Between 2019 and 2022, $28 million in revenue was generated from over 100,000 orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. The peak year was 2020, which saw the highest revenue ($10.2 million) and AOV ($300), likely driven by increased pandemic-related spending, while 2021 recorded the highest number of orders at 36,000.
<br><br>

<img width="700" alt="Seasonality" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96bf1b5c-9e63-499d-afe7-4866a8892994">
<br><br>

- **Seasonal Sales Patterns:** There is a holiday sales surge, with growth rates of 18% in November and 23% in December. This is followed by significant declines in January (-10%) and February (-25%), with a rebound of 18% in March. October sees potential sales stagnation as consumers may wait for holiday deals or shop elsewhere.
- **Consumer Behavior Insights:** The sales pattern aligns with typical electronics seasonality, with holiday promotions influencing consumer purchasing decisions. October’s lower activity highlights a potential opportunity to better engage customers before the holiday season.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:
- **Maximize November and December Promotions:** Expand marketing campaigns starting in early November to capitalize on the sales surge (18% in November and 23% in December) by highlighting exclusive deals, limited-time offers, and bundle packages to drive urgency and increase AOV.
- **Retain Post-Holiday Shoppers:** Offer “New Year” incentives in January to mitigate the 10% sales decline, such as discount codes for future purchases or post-holiday clearance sales.
- **Optimize for March Rebound:** Prepare a targeted campaign to capitalize on the 18% sales rebound in March, focusing on customers who paused spending after the holidays, and promote spring deals or "fresh start" themes tied to new product launches or upgrades
- **Investigate Drop-off Causes:** Conduct customer surveys and analyze competitor trends to understand consumer behavior in October and other slower months, testing incentives like early-bird discounts and pre-holiday bundles to encourage purchases before the deal season starts in November.
<br><br>

<br><br>

- **Loyalty Program Adoption and Performance:** The loyalty program, introduced in 2019, saw significant customer adoption beginning in 2021. Loyalty members consistently outperformed non-loyalty customers in terms of sales and order count from 2021 through 2022.
- **Higher AOV for Loyalty Customers:** Loyalty customers demonstrated not only higher order volumes but also a greater AOV compared to non-loyalty customers, indicating a trend of more frequent and higher-value purchases.
<br><br>

<img width="800" alt="Loyalty vs Non-Loyalty Sales" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4fb16e-a647-4c39-800e-627df524ee71">
<br><br>

- **Fluctuation in Loyalty Sales Performance:** While loyalty sales surpassed non-loyalty sales in April 2021, they fell below non-loyalty sales during the last four months of 2022, signaling a potential decline in loyalty engagement.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:
- **Investigate Recent Decline:** Conduct a detailed analysis to identify the factors contributing to the decline in loyalty sales over the last four months of 2022.
- **Enhance Engagement Strategies:** Revise and strengthen loyalty program initiatives to reinvigorate customer engagement and return to previous sales trends.
- **Targeted Campaigns:** Develop targeted marketing campaigns to further encourage frequent and higher-value purchases among loyalty customers to continue increasing the AOV.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Establish a robust mechanism to continuously monitor loyalty sales performance and proactively address emerging trends or issues.
<br><br>








### Marketing Strategies

#### Findings:

<img width="600" alt="Loyalty + Channel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee9d2c43-bf1b-47c9-9cdb-7d0e0ae3e06a">
<br><br>

- **Key Channels:** The **direct channel** is the most successful at acquiring customers (~84K) and generating loyalty signups (~32.9K) but has a moderate conversion rate to loyalty members (39%). The **email channel** ranks second in customer acquisition (~19K) and has the highest loyalty conversion rate (58%).
- **Data Gaps:** Marketing channels are unidentified for 82 "unknown" and 1,387 "blank" customers.
<br><br>

<img width="500" alt="Marketing Channels" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b2f563-b460-467d-b5a5-17a1c48139fd">
<br><br>

- **Other Channels:** Despite its low number of orders (2,900) and low loyalty member conversion rate (16%), the **affiliate channel** consistently achieves the highest AOV. The **social media channel** has a low number of orders (1,293) but demonstrates consistent AOV year-over-year and strong loyalty conversion performance (50%), second only to email marketing.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:
- **Direct Channel:** Focus marketing efforts on promoting products to maximize the large customer base, while deprioritizing loyalty program marketing due to its relatively lower success in converting customers to members.
- **Email Channel:** Emphasize acquiring more customers while leveraging its high loyalty conversion rate to grow loyalty program participation.
- **Affiliate Channel:** Shift the focus toward customer acquisition to capitalize on the high AOV, while deprioritizing loyalty program efforts for this channel due to its low conversion performance.
- **Social Media Channel:** Concentrate marketing efforts on acquiring more loyalty members by leveraging the strong loyalty conversion rate, while exploring strategies to increase overall order volume for better channel performance.
<br><br>








### Refund Analysis

#### Findings:

<img width="600" alt="Refund Rate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dc973f2-febf-43a0-9aa1-4fcfc98072eb">
<br><br>

<br><br>

- **Correlation Between AOV and Refund Rates:** A strong correlation exists (R-squared = 0.8843), suggesting that higher-priced items are more likely to have higher refund rates.
<br><br>

<img width="250" alt="Highest Refund Rate 10+ Orders" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9455e535-94a5-47fd-876b-f1d6d471c95a">

<br><br>

- **Country-Specific Refund Trends:** The table on the left lists the countries with the highest refund rates among those with 10 or more orders, while the table on the right highlights the countries with the highest refund rates among those with 100 or more orders.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:
- **Investigate High Refund Rates for Laptops:** Conduct an in-depth analysis of the ThinkPad Laptop and MacBook Air Laptop to identify the root causes of their high refund rates and implement targeted improvements to reduce them.
- **Monitor and Manage High-Value Product Refund Trends:** Develop strategies to mitigate refunds on high-priced items, such as improved customer education, enhanced product descriptions, and stricter quality control, while regularly reviewing the relationship between AOV and refund rates to maintain acceptable levels.
- **Address Country-Specific Refund Issues:** Analyze countries with small order volumes and high refund rates to identify regional factors. Implement localized measures, such as improved logistics, customer support, and tailored return policies, in countries with over 100 orders and refund rates above 6%.
<br><br>








### Purchasing Platforms

#### Findings:

<img width="500" alt="Product Performance - website" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0750e0e0-275e-4af1-b5ef-debe8b01012d">
<br><br>

- **Website Performance:** Total sales experienced significant growth in 2020, increasing by 164%, but then declined by 11% in 2021 and 46% in 2022. Both orders and AOV followed similar trends. Despite these fluctuations, all three metrics ended 2022 at levels higher than those recorded in 2019.
<br><br>

<img width="500" alt="Product Performance - mobile app" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b5bf24a-e4cb-4d9b-81bc-519e95b8ff35">
<br><br>

- **Mobile App Performance:** Total sales and order growth surged in 2020, saw slower growth in 2021, and experienced a sharp decline in 2022. Meanwhile, the AOV consistently dropped from $111 in 2019 to $36 in 2022, indicating a shift toward lower-cost items.
<br><br>

<img width="600" alt="Orders by Purchasing Platform" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86b05515-febc-455c-ad9a-9d9bc387a08d">
<br><br>

- **Customer Preferences:** The mobile app was predominantly used for purchasing lower-cost items, with 98% of Samsung Webcam sales and 43% of Samsung Charging Cable Pack sales made through the app. Higher-value items were primarily purchased through the website, highlighting a clear platform preference based on product value.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:
- **Mobile App Strategy:** Focus marketing efforts on lower-value items that align with customer purchase behavior, while expanding the inventory of popular products like the Samsung Charging Cable Pack and Samsung Webcam to maximize their demand.
- **Website Strategy:** Emphasize high-value items in marketing campaigns, leveraging the website's alignment with premium purchases, and ensure the site provides an optimal experience for customers seeking expensive products.
- **Cross-Channel Opportunity:** Use cross-promotion to encourage app users to complete higher-value purchases on the website, leveraging exclusive deals or bundles to entice them to explore premium items.
<br><br>








### Shipping Performance

#### Findings:

<img width="300" alt="Shipping Logistics" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f443ac-84bc-4171-9139-1681a6451c04">
<br><br>

- **Shipping and Delivery Times** Shipping times range from 1 to 3 days with an average of 2 days and delivery times range from 5 to 10 days with an average of 7.5 days.
<br><br>

<img width="300" alt="Refund Metrics" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd2cc5f-2c7f-4b1f-9bfa-89e2f3411975">
<br><br>

- **Refund Analysis:** Refunds show no correlation with shipping or delivery times, suggesting that customers are not requesting refunds due to delays.
- **Outliers in Orders:** Out of 108,124 orders, 41 outliers were identified and excluded. 18 orders have shipping dates that precede the purchase date. 23 orders exhibit abnormally long shipping times, ranging from 25 to 1297 days. These outliers represent a small fraction of the dataset and warrant separate analysis to uncover potential data quality issues, specifically related to the purchase date column.
<br><br>

#### Recommendations:

- **Addressing Outliers:** Investigate the purchase date column for the 18 orders with shipping dates preceding purchase dates to correct data entry or system errors. Analyze the 23 orders with extended shipping times to identify their root cause and determine if system improvements are needed.
- **Data Quality Improvements:** Implement validation checks to prevent shipping dates from preceding purchase dates. Set thresholds for shipping durations and create alert systems to flag unusually long shipping times.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue monitoring the refund process to ensure its independence from shipping and delivery performance, while periodically reviewing and auditing the data for consistency and accuracy to maintain reliability.
